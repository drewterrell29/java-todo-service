# java-todo-service
A small webservice meant to provide data to the ng-todo app.

Phase one, build out a real basic web service using by reverse-engineering the [Spring boot tutorial located here.](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)

Phase two, have the service return some basic data that matches the format in [my Ng-Todo app](https://github.com/AnthDotLee/ng-todo)

Phase three, link up some kind of Database to serve the data.
